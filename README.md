# Gear-Teeth-Calculation-for-a-Formula-Style-High-Performance-Car

This documentation relates to a MATLAB script designed for determining viable combinations of gear teeth numbers. The script iterates through predefined ranges of gear teeth and evaluates all specified constraints. Combinations that meet all criteria are recorded for further analysis, considering factors like gear safety and weight. Detailed investigation in subsequent steps is essential due to these factors.

Key Constraints:

Target gear ratio is approximately 12.48 Â± 0.15, as initially estimated for vehicle dynamics.
Profile shift sums must be between 0.9 and 1.2 to enhance flank and tooth root safety.
Maximum gear diameter set to 120mm as a preliminary constraint.
